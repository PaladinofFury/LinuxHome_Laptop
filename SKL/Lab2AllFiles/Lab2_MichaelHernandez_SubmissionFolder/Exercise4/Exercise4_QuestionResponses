1. In java the array would be declared using the "new" operator to give it the appropriate space in memory.
2. Done.
3. Done.
4. The pointer version is better on the basis that it uses less memory. The function does not need to 
    create copies of the data structures when called because they are using the objects themselves via pointer.
5. We set each pointer variable to null after deleting them because their names are still valid, even though their memory is no longer
    reserved for use by the program. We don't want to cause any issues by accidentally calling those variables after we have deleted them.
